3. Optional

   Ideally, a Windows 11 laptop is used for this optional tool. You could use a Mac or Linxu laptop, but for installing the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool you will need a Windows VM installed / available.

   a. If you bring a Windows laptop, you are welcome to install the latest Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (free):
   
        https://aka.ms/threatmodelingtool

        (NOTE: This works on Windows OS only - which is the reason this is optional.)
    
        We plan to demo the software briefly, but it won't be used directly for hands-on exercises.
